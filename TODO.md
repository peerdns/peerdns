# General TODO

- [x] Proper identity management package needs to be built, at least the basic stuff.
- [ ] First phase is to fully connect validators with each other over DHT.
- [ ] There should be a genesis in which, validators including initial block information is created. Should be yaml and not json...
- [ ] Pinging mesh network so we can collect statistics about the network itself.
- [ ] Networking needs hosts.go where actual host management, creation, etc... will be done...
- [ ] Consensus, metrics separation within networking package needs to happen. 
- [ ] Observability package needs to support with TLS connectivity to GRPC (traces) and there should be nice way to do this.
